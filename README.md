# Python-For-Math-Profs
Python for engineering math college professors

For root professors that give classes in calculus, algebra, etc... only pen-and-paper. How to get updated gives life to the classes, and engages students.

Students can learn and do much more with the knowledge of undergrad traditional theoretical classes with computation! Apply theory to real-world problems and compute!
